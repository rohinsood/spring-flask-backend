# Spring-Flask-Backend 🍵🐍
- This project repo can be used to run both a **Java Spring** and a **Python Flask** server in the same Docker instance.
- This can be deployed with this [blog](https://rift24.github.io/RIFT-Frontend/2024/01/30/deployment_IPYNB_2_.html), there simply needs to be two configurations for both servers
